# My 2023 UCP Problem A Solution

This repository contains a solution to the 2023 University Competition of Physics (UCP) Problem A. Please note that the solution provided here is a work in progress, and there may still be unresolved issues. The solution involves a simple model and includes a paper written in LaTeX, code for calculations and function fitting, and the corresponding PDF of the paper.

## Features

- Detailed solution to the 2023 UCP Problem A.
- LaTeX paper with explanations and mathematical derivations.
- MATLAB code for calculations and function fitting.

## Usage

To use this repository, follow these instructions:

### Running the MATLAB Code

1. Ensure you have MATLAB installed on your system.

2. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Neurnia/2023-UCP.git
   cd your-repo
   ```

3. Open MATLAB and navigate to the directory containing the MATLAB scripts.

4. Run the MATLAB scripts as needed for your analysis.

### Compiling the LaTeX Paper

1. You can find the LaTeX paper in the `paper` directory of this repository.

2. To compile the LaTeX paper and generate the PDF, you'll need a LaTeX distribution installed on your system (e.g., TeX Live or MiKTeX).

3. Navigate to the `paper` directory:

   ```bash
   cd paper
   ```

4. Compile the LaTeX paper using the appropriate command. For example, you can use `pdflatex` to generate the PDF:

   ```bash
   pdflatex paper.tex
   bibtex paper
   pdflatex paper.tex
   pdflatex paper.tex
   ```

   You might need to run these commands multiple times to resolve references and generate the PDF properly.

5. The compiled PDF of the paper should be available as `paper.pdf` in the same directory.
